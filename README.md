# My Thoughts

## Initial Thoughts

Associations seem easy to get lost in. The way I name things is going to seem very important here.
With more practice they shouldn't seem as intimidating. Welp here we go!

## Final Thoughts

Associations are so much trickier than I thought! BUT, I am getting the hang of them. I also think I need to practice my
queries more. There were a few times where I knew what I wanted but I didn't know how to get it. More practice! Besides
that I really liked this project!

## My Highlights

### Event Invites

My favorite feature is the ability to invite another user to a party. It took using another through table called invites
and more associations but it was fun! I really liked the scope that was able to filter out users who hadn't been invited
to an event. It made listing out possible invites so much easier! While there was more that could be done with the
feature, like adding a search box for a user instead of choose from a long list of users on the page, I am very proud of
how the feature came out

### Selecting An Event To Attend

I'm not going to lie I really struggled with this feature at first and it's because I didn't know how to route it. Even
now I feel like my solution wasn't the best it does get the job done. Adding someone to the EventsDetails table was done
with a simple create action and a few ID's.

### My Devise Ussage

I feel like I was used Devise much better here than in my previous project. I was constantly filtering out actions for
users that were signed in. I also created my own filter to confirm that the creator of an event was the only that could
edit it and invite people to it. Overall, I believe I am starting to get more comfortable with Devise.

## Outro

Onto the next set of stuff to learn. I hope I learn about testing soon because man am I tired of just trying stuff
and seeing if I get an error. I feel like I am doing the equivalent of just putting print statements everywhere! Alright,
enough yapping...bye!
